Open the index.html in your favorite browser
This application works best in Firefox but there is an issue with some configurations where the stopwatch lap times are not displayed. 
IE works well but it does fail to display the custom font.
Google Chrome does not allow Worker threads therefore the whole application will not work in a regular configuration.
Tu bypass start Chrome with the --allow-file-access-from-files console\terminal\command line switch, which will solve the issue.

markup/ contains the custom font used
media/ contains all custom images used
